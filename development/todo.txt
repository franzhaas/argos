Argos philosophy:
    -   Argos is a reader, not a writer.
        It opens all files read-only. No modification will ever be performed on a data file.
    -   Argos is single threaded to keep it simple.
    -   Argos shall remain a stand-alone tool and not become a part of other projects such as
        IPython or Spyder.

    PyQtGraph:
        - Mouse buttons
        - Zoom buttons
        - ExceptHook
        - Handle Nans
        - Handle masked arrays
        - Warning QApplication created before...

    PgColorBar:
        - Default extent = 100 % of pixels
        - Clear histogram when image is set to empty. (clear color scale?)


TODO short term:

    axesNames: rows, columns in table inspector.
    resize repo should resize the name column.

    There seems to be a bug when closing opening mydict/pandas test data
    The contents is removed. When closing mydict, only subdicts are removed.

    What to do with (json) lists. Convert to array?
    Tooltips for spin-slider in collector
    Warning in text inspector if more than one element is selected.

    JSON files in text/table inspector. Yaml files.

    Bugs and issues
    ---------------
        IrisCC motor data units is in meters while attribute is in millimeters.
        Probably because it is a structured array with to (m) units

        Using "argos ." doesn't expand the directory (at least on Windows)

        Open/close item doesn't work with memoryctis.MappingRti (and perhaps other memory RTIs)
            After closing and opening, the child nodes have disappeared.

        Reload file from context menu gives error

        What if the H5 only has a dimension label? 2020-10-04. What is this? Perhaps mini_scanner_output

        What if they have multiple dimension scales?
            /argos/mini_scanner_output/multiple_dimension_scales.h5

        Remove warnings if all elements in the slice have the same value.


TODO mid term:
    During log test walks the program seems to slow down.
        E.g. "ucar\test_echam_spectral-deflated.nc" takes one minute during a full ucar test, and
        only half a minute when testing it alone (only table inspector, log level info).

    Fixed font size in tables and trees so that windows10 with two monitors works. (setFixedPitch)

    Zebra striping?
    The problem is that the currently selected RTI is poorly visible when the data tree loses focus. Fix with CSS?

    Exporter to PNG

    Automated testing (check AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and TravisCI)

    Create HDF5 test data from: https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Other+Examples

    Make Rti.isFileFileFormat that opens a file and check if the RTI supports this.
        Call this only for RTIs that are visible in the tree (e.g. when the icons is queried by the model.
        Make an RTI that serves as a placeholder and shows name. This way large directories can opened quickly
        but only visible files are opened and checked.

    Split screen for inspectors/config

    Histogram / statistics inspector.

    Look at QSizePolicy::setControlType

    Default outlier percentage op 0.1%?

	Interaction in IPython

    Consider getting rid of fake dimensions in getSlicedArray because it fails with masked arrays with fill values.

        The less we do there, the less chance an error occurs.

    Editable defaults in config tree.

    Test ExdirFieldRti


TODO long term:

    When the collector can have multiple entries, the RtiPlugin can select them by default.
    E.g. you can make an TropL2 RTI pluting that always selects the lat and lon dimension on the
    x-axis. If a ncdf/hdf file follows the CF conventions, we can use that instead.

    Drag and drop from file manager.

    Matplotlib inspector

   	Combine property, dimension and attribute tables dock windows in a tree in a single dockwindow.
   	    Config values.

    Table inspector flip Y axis?

    Changing the inspector should not change the collector spinboxes.

    TextView inspector
        XML pretty print.

    Use valid_range attributes to determine the color range (crossPlotAutoRangeMethods) (or set them in the mask?)

TODO Long term or nice to have:

    Downsample large slices (e.g. read a 300 MB wav file into a table or lineplot.)

    nested arrays (/argos/idl-sav-files/qds_dd.sav/qds_dd/OCCURRENCES) (need to read first element)

    Look at Qt::ItemIsAutoTristate and Qt::ItemIsUserTristate

THINK:
	relative imports? What's the use except for easy relocation of packeges?
	    A google search seems to indicate that it doesn't always work ok (although these days most
	    issues are ironed out). Futhermore using if __name__ == "__main__" is then problematic.


    _drawContents raises an InvalidDataError exception when no valid data is available.
    If we would check for invalid data in AbstractInspector.drawContents, we must call
    collected.getSlicedArray. This may be slow, so to avoid calling it twice the sliced array should
    then be passed as a parameter to _drawContents. However, this may become complicated later, when
    are multiple collected arrays will be implemented.


	use decorators in AbstractLazyLoadTreeItem?
	createFromFileName does not work with memory RTI. Options:
		1) Implement resource attribute.
			Cons: where to set the fileName = os.path.realpath(resource) (in a setter?)
		2) Implement createFromResource method. Don't check file names in children? How?
		3) Separate fileName and resource attributes (which is a bit of a duplicated effort)

	When there are multiple repo tree viewers, do they share a selection? Or do the details
		only work per repo tree viewer?
		# https://steveire.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/sharing-a-qitemselection-between-views-through-proxy-models/

	Collectors must be able to do small calculations? (e.g. auto-signal = exp - dark). Probably not!
	Inspectors can do calculations as well (e.g. image processing; select filter in combobox)

	If a new RTI is selected, does the plot range need to be updated? Yes, the unit will change.


USE CASES:
	Select 3 lines of a wavelength map (at 0 and extreme swath angles), then select another detector.
	Compare irrads


BUGS:



Zero sized array in.

Gives error in image plot:

        res = np.fmin.reduce(a, axis=axis, out=out, **kwargs)
    ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity
    Perhaps fix win new color range.






NEXT VERSION:

    Reload gives error for memory RTIs. TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dictionary'
        Disable reload? Better try to implement this similarly to the object browser.
        All memory RTIs constructors should probably have an obj parameter instead of the file_name.
        The file_name parameter should be added by descendants that actual use it.
        However, the file_name should be passed on to children. So no.

    Why does /argos/ucar/IMAGE0002.nc/dataWidth have no shape?
        Because it is a scalar, which is perfectly valid in NetCDF.
        I can't open this file in h5py though (file signature not found). This seems a h5py problem because it can be
        opened with HDFView.

    Seems to have the wrong data in hdf-5. Same issue as at KNMI

            was: size of tuple must match number of fields. (This was due to numpy 1.11.1, fixed 1.11.2).
                This was because the length of dtype.descr != .dtype.names because of padding.

            also was: Had 'NotImplementedType' object has no attribute 'ndim'  (when reading with H5py mode!), this is fixed now

        Crash in numpy 1.11.1
        Wrong data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) h5py
        Correct data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) NCDF

        The wrong data order was probably due to files made in libhdf 1.8 that where read with libhdf 1.10 or vice versa (e.g. KNMI ICM file)


    PyQtGraph issue:
        Set the {path} the plot title, then set the {name} in the plot title. The title is not centered.
