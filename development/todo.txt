Argos philosophy:
    -   Argos is a reader, not a writer.
        It opens all files read-only. No modification will ever be performed on a data file.
    -   Argos is single threaded to keep it simple.
    -   Argos shall remain a stand-alone tool and not become a part of other projects such as
        IPython or Spyder.



TODO short term:

    New Features
    ------------

        quickview tab

        PgColorBar must be extendable at one side (bottom or top of the range)


    Think about it
    --------------
        Zoom is reset when changing RGB in image (and other RTIs)

        -o/--open so that files after this command line option are opened.
            Can probably replace the -s option
            What happens if files occur twice when opening them?

        Reset range when a variable with a new unit/abcissa is selected?
            Hard to determine the new unit and dimensions.
            Change if unit is new or combox dim is new.
            Keep collector state (comboboxes, when the dimensions of the new RTI are the same as of the old)

        Better color for rectangle zoom

        Good message when no data is plotted. (/argos/ucar/IMAGE0002.nc/auditTrail)

        Is is possible to do interpolation in image scan so that lines in \spectral\cube.h5\intensities are visible?

        Better probe labels. Use dimension names in probe name. E.g. myvalue = 5.22 @ pos (dim-1, dim-2) = (13, 4)

    Bugs and issues
    ---------------
        Fixed font size in tables and trees so that windows10 with two monitors works. (setFixedPitch)

        Why does /argos/ucar/IMAGE0002.nc/dataWidth have no shape?

        Waarom doet autorange het niet in rigolscan_partial?

        What if the H5 only has a dimension label?

        Empty (Null) datasets and attributes
        http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/high/dataset.html#creating-and-reading-empty-or-null-datasets-and-attributes

        HDF5 dataset with dimensions of size 0

        Installed plugins dialog doesn't work if scipy is not installed.  (Test under Linux)

        WavFileRti._closeResources doesn't reset attribute correctly. Fix and check in other classes

        Fix error: on Windows browsing a single drive (e.g. 'C:\') fails.
        
        Items in header context menu are not checked while header is visible in table. 
        Checking and then unchecking fixes the issue.
        
        When starting Argos (installed with pip -e (on my Windows laptop)) it can't be started from outside it's conda environment.
        E.g. starting from a regular cmd shell gives.

    Cleanup and release
    -------------------

        Consistent use of capitals in table headers.

        check if mid & long term todos are still needed

        all log.warn -> log.warning

        remove obsolete todo's in code.



TODO mid term:

    look at h5py 3.0

    Exporter to PNG


    Automated testing (check AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and TravisCI)


    Make Rti.isFileFileFormat that opens a file and check if the RTI supports this.
        Call this only for RTIs that are visible in the tree (e.g. when the icons is queried by the model.
        Make an RTI that serves as a placeholder and shows name. This way large directories can opened quickly
        but only visible files are opened and checked.

    Split screen for inspectors/config

    Histogram / statistics inspector.

    Better log config

    Look at QSizePolicy::setControlType

    Default outlier percentage op 0.1%?

	Interaction in IPython
	(auto)refresh

    Consider getting rid of fake dimensions in getSlicedArray because it fails with masked arrays with fill values.
        /argos/trop/2015_03_16T16_32_16_MonA/after_dccorr_l1bavg/trl1brb8g.lx.nc/BAND8/
            ICID_30683_GROUP_00001/INSTRUMENT/housekeeping_data
        The less we do there, the less chance an error occurs.

    Editable defaults in config.

    Test ExdirFieldRti



TODO long term:

    When the collector can have multiple entries, the RtiPlugin can select them by default.
    E.g. you can make an TropL2 RTI pluting that always selects the lat and lon dimension on the
    x-axis. If a ncdf/hdf file follows the CF conventions, we can use that instead.

    Drag and drop from file manager.

    Matplotlib inspector

    Better PyQtGraph histogram/color bar.
        Submit bug reports on

   	Combine property, dimension and attribute tables dock windows in a tree in a single dockwindow.
   	    Config values.

    Table inspector flip Y axis?

    Changing the inspector should not change the collector spinboxes.

    TextView inspector
        XML pretty print.

    Use valid_range attributes to determine the color range (crossPlotAutoRangeMethods) (or set them in the mask?)

    Look at declaritive plotting:
        https://altair-viz.github.io/
        https://vega.github.io/vega/

Collectors:
	test with Evoss sciamachy products


Handle Exception:
	Raise with old exception handler.
	Quit button.
	Resize message box.

Test:
	Memory leaks?

TODO Long term or nice to have:

    Reset buttons on groupCTI always visible?

    Downsample large slices (e.g. read a 300 MB wav file into a table or lineplot.)

    nested arrays (/argos/idl-sav-files/qds_dd.sav/qds_dd/OCCURRENCES) (need to read first element)
	confirm on error when editing cell
	make argos assert and assertEqual function for sanity checks (consistent "please report this bug" text)
	persistent expand of config options?
	thinks how to stretch last line when toggling columns on/off (recalc column size?)
	let repo tree view work with multiple selected items
	example RTI using XML file.

	Register plugins without having to restart (merge ClassRegistry and RegistryTableModel).
	http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins

    Look at Qt::ItemIsAutoTristate and Qt::ItemIsUserTristate

THINK:
	relative imports? What's the use except for easy relocation of packeges?
	    A google search seems to indicate that it doesn't always work ok (although these days most
	    issues are ironed out). Futhermore using if __name__ == "__main__" is then problematic.


    _drawContents raises an InvalidDataError exception when no valid data is available.
    If we would check for invalid data in AbstractInspector.drawContents, we must call
    collected.getSlicedArray. This may be slow, so to avoid calling it twice the sliced array should
    then be passed as a parameter to _drawContents. However, this may become complicated later, when
    are multiple collected arrays will be implemented.


	use decorators in AbstractLazyLoadTreeItem?
	createFromFileName does not work with memory RTI. Options:
		1) Implement resource attribute.
			Cons: where to set the fileName = os.path.realpath(resource) (in a setter?)
		2) Implement createFromResource method. Don't check file names in children? How?
		3) Separate fileName and resource attributes (which is a bit of a duplicated effort)

	When there are multiple repo tree viewers, do they share a selection? Or do the details
		only work per repo tree viewer?
		# https://steveire.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/sharing-a-qitemselection-between-views-through-proxy-models/

	Collectors must be able to do small calculations? (e.g. auto-signal = exp - dark). Probably not!
	Inspectors can do calculations as well (e.g. image processing; select filter in combobox)

	If a new RTI is selected, does the plot range need to be updated? Yes, the unit will change.


USE CASES:
	Select 3 lines of a wavelength map (at 0 and extreme swath angles), then select another detector.
	Compare irrads


BUGS:



Zero sized array in.
/Users/kenter/work/spec-ind/data/tata/TATA scan3/TATA_scan1_x124_y019_2500.h5 /rawData/timestamp
Gives error in image plot:

        res = np.fmin.reduce(a, axis=axis, out=out, **kwargs)
    ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity
    Perhaps fix win new color range.






NEXT VERSION:

    Reload gives error for memory RTIs. TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dictionary'
        Disable reload? Better try to implement this similarly to the object browser.
        All memory RTIs constructors should probably have an obj parameter instead of the file_name.
        The file_name parameter should be added by descendants that actual use it.
        However, the file_name should be passed on to children. So no.

            was: size of tuple must match number of fields. (This was due to numpy 1.11.1, fixed 1.11.2).
                This was because the length of dtype.descr != .dtype.names because of padding.

            also was: Had 'NotImplementedType' object has no attribute 'ndim'  (when reading with H5py mode!), this is fixed now

        Crash in numpy 1.11.1
        Wrong data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) h5py
        Correct data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) NCDF

        The wrong data order was probably due to files made in libhdf 1.8 that where read with libhdf 1.10 or vice versa (e.g. KNMI ICM file)


    PyQtGraph issue:
        Set the {path} the plot title, then set the {name} in the plot title. The title is not centered.
