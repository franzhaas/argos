Argos philosophy:
    -   Argos is a reader, not a writer.
        It opens all files read-only. No modification will ever be performed on a data file.
    -   Argos is single threaded to keep it simple.
    -   Argos shall remain a stand-alone tool and not become a part of other projects such as
        IPython or Spyder.

    PyQtGraph:
        - Mouse buttons
        - Zoom buttons
        - ExceptHook
        - Handle Nans
        - Handle masked arrays
        - Warning QApplication created before...

    PgColorBar:
        - Default extent = 100 % of pixels
        - Clear histogram when image is set to empty. (clear color scale?)

    CmLib:
        Comboboxes for catalog and category
        Show somehow the number of color scales

TODO short term:

    New Features
    ------------

        quickview tab

        PgColorBar must be extendable at one side (bottom or top of the range)

        chunks in properties tab

    Think about it
    --------------
        RTI_CHANGED         = "repo tree item changed"
        COLLECTOR_COMBO_BOX = "collector combobox changed"
        COLLECTOR_SPIN_BOX  = "collector spinbox changed"

        Zoom is reset when changing RGB in image (and other RTIs)

        Reset range when a variable with a new unit/abcissa is selected?
            Hard to determine the new unit and dimensions.
            Change if unit is new or combox dim is new.

            Keep collector state (comboboxes, when the dimensions of the new RTI are the same as of the old)
            Test with tata cube.h5

            "Reset ranges" button
            Auto reset checkbox


        Better color for rectangle zoom
        Inferno as default color map?
        Smaller text edit in color config

        Is is possible to do interpolation in image scan so that lines in \spectral\cube.h5\intensities are visible?

        Better probe labels. Use dimension names in probe name. E.g. myvalue = 5.22 @ pos (dim-1, dim-2) = (13, 4)

        Hamburger menu button in table headers to show/hide rows? Zebra striping?
        The problem is that the currently selected RTI is poorly visible when the data tree loses focus. Fix with CSS?

    Bugs and issues
    ---------------

        Fixed font size in tables and trees so that windows10 with two monitors works. (setFixedPitch)

        Closing an RTI redraws all RTIs below it, which is ugly. Simply collapsing them does not.

        Remove all argos imports from the top of main.py and add it again __init__.py

    Cleanup and release
    -------------------

        Consistent use of capitals in table headers.

        check if mid & long term todos are still needed

        all log.warn -> log.warning

        remove obsolete todo's in code.

        check plugin descriptions / docstrings



TODO mid term:

    Exporter to PNG

    Automated testing (check AppVeyor, Azure Pipelines, CircleCI and TravisCI)

    Create HDF5 test data from: https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/Other+Examples

    Make Rti.isFileFileFormat that opens a file and check if the RTI supports this.
        Call this only for RTIs that are visible in the tree (e.g. when the icons is queried by the model.
        Make an RTI that serves as a placeholder and shows name. This way large directories can opened quickly
        but only visible files are opened and checked.

    Split screen for inspectors/config

    Histogram / statistics inspector.

    Look at QSizePolicy::setControlType

    Bugs and issues
    ---------------

        What if the H5 only has a dimension label? 2020-10-04. What is this?

        What if they have multiple dimension scales?
            /argos/mini_scanner_output/multiple_dimension_scales.h5


TODO long term:

    When the collector can have multiple entries, the RtiPlugin can select them by default.
    E.g. you can make an TropL2 RTI pluting that always selects the lat and lon dimension on the
    x-axis. If a ncdf/hdf file follows the CF conventions, we can use that instead.

    Drag and drop from file manager.

    Look at Qt::ItemIsAutoTristate and Qt::ItemIsUserTristate

THINK:
	relative imports? What's the use except for easy relocation of packeges?
	    A google search seems to indicate that it doesn't always work ok (although these days most
	    issues are ironed out). Futhermore using if __name__ == "__main__" is then problematic.


    _drawContents raises an InvalidDataError exception when no valid data is available.
    If we would check for invalid data in AbstractInspector.drawContents, we must call
    collected.getSlicedArray. This may be slow, so to avoid calling it twice the sliced array should
    then be passed as a parameter to _drawContents. However, this may become complicated later, when
    are multiple collected arrays will be implemented.


	use decorators in AbstractLazyLoadTreeItem?
	createFromFileName does not work with memory RTI. Options:
		1) Implement resource attribute.
			Cons: where to set the fileName = os.path.realpath(resource) (in a setter?)
		2) Implement createFromResource method. Don't check file names in children? How?
		3) Separate fileName and resource attributes (which is a bit of a duplicated effort)

	When there are multiple repo tree viewers, do they share a selection? Or do the details
		only work per repo tree viewer?
		# https://steveire.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/sharing-a-qitemselection-between-views-through-proxy-models/

	Collectors must be able to do small calculations? (e.g. auto-signal = exp - dark). Probably not!
	Inspectors can do calculations as well (e.g. image processing; select filter in combobox)

	If a new RTI is selected, does the plot range need to be updated? Yes, the unit will change.


USE CASES:
	Select 3 lines of a wavelength map (at 0 and extreme swath angles), then select another detector.
	Compare irrads


BUGS:



Zero sized array in.
/Users/kenter/work/spec-ind/data/tata/TATA scan3/TATA_scan1_x124_y019_2500.h5 /rawData/timestamp
Gives error in image plot:

        res = np.fmin.reduce(a, axis=axis, out=out, **kwargs)
    ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity
    Perhaps fix win new color range.






NEXT VERSION:

    Reload gives error for memory RTIs. TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dictionary'
        Disable reload? Better try to implement this similarly to the object browser.
        All memory RTIs constructors should probably have an obj parameter instead of the file_name.
        The file_name parameter should be added by descendants that actual use it.
        However, the file_name should be passed on to children. So no.

        Because it is a scalar, which is perfectly valid in NetCDF.
        I can't open this file in h5py though (file signature not found). This seems a h5py problem because it can be
        opened with HDFView.

            was: size of tuple must match number of fields. (This was due to numpy 1.11.1, fixed 1.11.2).
                This was because the length of dtype.descr != .dtype.names because of padding.

            also was: Had 'NotImplementedType' object has no attribute 'ndim'  (when reading with H5py mode!), this is fixed now

        Crash in numpy 1.11.1
        Wrong data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) h5py
        Correct data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) NCDF

        The wrong data order was probably due to files made in libhdf 1.8 that where read with libhdf 1.10 or vice versa (e.g. KNMI ICM file)


    PyQtGraph issue:
        Set the {path} the plot title, then set the {name} in the plot title. The title is not centered.
