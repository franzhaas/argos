Argos philosophy:
    -   Argos is a reader, not a writer.
        It opens all files read-only. No modification will ever be performed on a data file.
    -   Argos is single threaded to keep it simple.
    -   Argos shall remain a stand-alone tool and not become a part of other projects such as
        IPython or Spyder.



TODO short term:


    pyqtgraph 0.11 testen

    close files on collapse.

    -o/--open so that files after this command line option are opened.
        Can probably replace the -s option
        What happens if files occur twice when opening them?

    argos --help on Windows (Beast) doesn't seem to give output)

    cross hair in the middle of the pixel

    Fixed font size in tables so that windows10 with two monitors works. (setFixedPitch)

    What if the H5 only has a dimension label?

    Empty (Null) datasets and attributes
    http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/high/dataset.html#creating-and-reading-empty-or-null-datasets-and-attributes

    HDF5 dataset with dimensions of size 0

    Exporter to PNG

    Old numpy support.

    Installed plugins dialog doesn't work if scipy is not installed.  (Test under Linux)

	Reset range when a variable with a new unit/abcissa is selected?
	    Hard to determine the new unit and dimensions.
	    Change if unit is new or combox dim is new.
	    Keep collector state (comboboxes, when the dimensions of the new RTI are the same as of the old)

    Better plugin management.
    Show both error and description in plugins dialog.

    Reset color and histogram range in context menu of 2D image plot.

    Mousewheel click on color bar should autorange color bar.
    Right click in menu to reset color range

    Reset buttons on groupCTI always visible?
    Rename dock widget title of config widget from Application settings to settings
    No separate color of the top level row

    Good message when no data is plotted. (/argos/ucar/IMAGE0002.nc/auditTrail)

    Flip Y image Y-axis by default.


TODO mid term:

    Split screen for inspectors/config

    Histogram / statistics inspector.

    Better log config

    Look at QSizePolicy::setControlType

    Default outlier percentage op 0.1%?

	Interaction in IPython
	QSettings should not use titusjan by default
	(auto)refresh

    Consider getting rid of fake dimensions in getSlicedArray because it fails with masked arrays with fill values.

            ICID_30683_GROUP_00001/INSTRUMENT/housekeeping_data
        The less we do there, the less chance an error occurs.

TODO long term:

    Drag and drop from file manager.

    Matplotlib inspector

    Better PyQtGraph histogram/color bar.
        Submit bug reports on

   	Combine property, dimension and attribute tables dock windows in a tree in a single dockwindow.
   	    Config values.

    Table inspector flip Y axis?

    Changing the inspector should not change the collector spinboxes.

    TextView inspector
        XML pretty print.

    Use valid_range attributes to determine the color range (crossPlotAutoRangeMethods) (or set them in the mask?)

    Look at declaritive plotting:
        https://altair-viz.github.io/
        https://vega.github.io/vega/

Collectors:
	test with Evoss sciamachy products


Handle Exception:
	Raise with old exception handler.
	Quit button.
	Resize message box.

Test:
	Memory leaks?

TODO Long term or nice to have:

    Downsample large slices (e.g. read a 300 MB wav file into a table or lineplot.)

    nested arrays (/argos/idl-sav-files/qds_dd.sav/qds_dd/OCCURRENCES) (need to read first element)
	confirm on error when editing cell
	make argos assert and assertEqual function for sanity checks (consistent "please report this bug" text)
	read/write config to yaml, QSettings.
	persistent expand of config options?
	thinks how to stretch last line when toggling columns on/off (recalc column size?)
	let repo tree view work with multiple selected items
	example RTI using XML file.
	fits format http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/ (astropy)
	geotiff format (attributes). (https://aws.amazon.com/public-data-sets/landsat/)

	Qt::SizeHintRole in toggleTreeView?
	http://snorf.net/blog/2014/08/09/validating-user-input-in-pyqt4-using-qvalidator/
	Register plugins without having to restart (merge ClassRegistry and RegistryTableModel).
	http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins

    Look at Qt::ItemIsAutoTristate and Qt::ItemIsUserTristate

THINK:
	relative imports? What's the use except for easy relocation of packeges?
	    A google search seems to indicate that it doesn't always work ok (although these days most
	    issues are ironed out). Futhermore using if __name__ == "__main__" is then problematic.


    _drawContents raises an InvalidDataError exception when no valid data is available.
    If we would check for invalid data in AbstractInspector.drawContents, we must call
    collected.getSlicedArray. This may be slow, so to avoid calling it twice the sliced array should
    then be passed as a parameter to _drawContents. However, this may become complicated later, when
    are multiple collected arrays will be implemented.


	use decorators in AbstractLazyLoadTreeItem?
	createFromFileName does not work with memory RTI. Options:
		1) Implement resource attribute.
			Cons: where to set the fileName = os.path.realpath(resource) (in a setter?)
		2) Implement createFromResource method. Don't check file names in children? How?
		3) Separate fileName and resource attributes (which is a bit of a duplicated effort)

	When there are multiple repo tree viewers, do they share a selection? Or do the details
		only work per repo tree viewer?
		# https://steveire.wordpress.com/2010/04/20/sharing-a-qitemselection-between-views-through-proxy-models/

	Collectors must be able to do small calculations? (e.g. auto-signal = exp - dark). Probably not!
	Inspectors can do calculations as well (e.g. image processing; select filter in combobox)

	If a new RTI is selected, does the plot range need to be updated? Yes, the unit will change.


USE CASES:
	Select 3 lines of a wavelength map (at 0 and extreme swath angles), then select another detector.
	Compare irrads


BUGS:



Zero sized array in.
/Users/kenter/work/spec-ind/data/tata/TATA scan3/TATA_scan1_x124_y019_2500.h5 /rawData/timestamp
Gives error in image plot:
      File "/Users/kenter/prog/external/argos/argos/inspector/pgplugins/pghistlutitem.py", line 199, in imageChanged
        histRange = (np.nanmin(img), np.nanmax(img))
      File "/Users/kenter/miniconda3/envs/argos/lib/python3.5/site-packages/numpy/lib/nanfunctions.py", line 240, in nanmin
        res = np.fmin.reduce(a, axis=axis, out=out, **kwargs)
    ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation fmin which has no identity
    Perhaps fix win new color range.






NEXT VERSION:

    Table headers in attributes/properties/dimensions are not persistent.

    Reload gives error for memory RTIs. TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'dictionary'
        Disable reload? Better try to implement this similarly to the object browser.
        All memory RTIs constructors should probably have an obj parameter instead of the file_name.
        The file_name parameter should be added by descendants that actual use it.
        However, the file_name should be passed on to children. So no.

            was: size of tuple must match number of fields. (This was due to numpy 1.11.1, fixed 1.11.2).
                This was because the length of dtype.descr != .dtype.names because of padding.

            also was: Had 'NotImplementedType' object has no attribute 'ndim'  (when reading with H5py mode!), this is fixed now

        Crash in numpy 1.11.1
        Wrong data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) h5py
        Correct data: 2.6.0 (libhdf5: 1.8.17) NCDF

        The wrong data order was probably due to files made in libhdf 1.8 that where read with libhdf 1.10 or vice versa (e.g. KNMI ICM file)


    PyQtGraph issue:
        Set the {path} the plot title, then set the {name} in the plot title. The title is not centered.
